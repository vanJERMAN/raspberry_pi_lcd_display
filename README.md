# raspberry_pi_lcd_display
#For everyone who wants to use LCD 1602 Display for Raspberry Pi, 16x2 i2c HD44780.

#This script goes with the ones, that can be downloaded from: https://github.com/the-raspberry-pi-guy/lcd.git
#The main differenc is, that the code from "https://github.com/the-raspberry-pi-guy/lcd.git", can display two strings, 16 char long (top, bottom).
#My script can accept top string, that is longer than 16 characters. It has two options of scrolling :) feel free to try them both.
#For any question, feel free to contact me on: vanjermancek@gmail.com
